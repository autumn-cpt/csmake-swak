    """Purpose:
           When executed, will modify the current version to include
           specified information.
           A special field is enclosed in curly braces, i.e. {datetime}
           The module may be specialized to allow for special fields
           calculated in ways not anticipated by this module
           Essentially, you can specify a constant, a shell calculated value,
               or a value returned from a module.
       Type: Module   Library: csmake-swak
       Phases: *any*
       Options:
           env-name=Environment variable to set with the formatted result
           format= Any string.  keys are enclosed with curlies
                    e.g., {datetime}.{getSHA}
                Note: Any specified csmake environment variables are substituted
                before the keys are processed.
                To escape curly braces - double the right side
                    e.g.,  {my}} Will literally be {my} in the result
           shell_<key>= executes a shell command and puts the result in for
                        any references of <key>
           step_<key>= executes a specified step and puts the result in for
                        any references of <key>
           value_<key>= places the string in for any references of key
           dry-run=(OPTIONAL) If true will only return the calculated
                   version string without updating the metadata.
