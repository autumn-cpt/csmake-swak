class ChrootShell(Shell):
    """Purpose: Execute out to a shell command in a chroot environment
       Type: Module   Library: csmake-swak
       Options:
           command - shell command to execute (semi-colons need to be escaped)
             use command(<phase>) to specify the command for a given phase
             default is 'build'
           env - (OPTIONAL) Reference to a ShellEnv to use
                 Can be multiple envs, comma separated
                 These environment definitions will be used in conjunction
                 with the current DIB environment.
           exec - (OPTIONAL) command to execute
           chroot - (OPTIONAL) path to the chroot
                     If not given, this will behave just like Shell
           as-user - (OPTIONAL) sudo to given user
                     (requires sudo installed in chroot environment)
       Phase: Any
       Notes: chrooting requires sudo access
           The chroot execution works by
           doing sudo -E chroot bash -c "<contents of command>"
           On execution, csmake will escape ` " and $ so that they will
           not be expanded outside of the execution of the "command"
       Example:
           [ShellEnv@my-command-env]
           THIS_DIR=mydir

           [ChrootShell@my-command]
           command = mkdir -p ${THIS_DIR} && pushd ${THIS_DIR}
              ifconfig > my.cfg
              ls
              popd
              ls
           env = my-command-env, default-env
           chroot = /path/to/my/chroot
