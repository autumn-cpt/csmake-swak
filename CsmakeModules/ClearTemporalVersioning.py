       Type: Module   Library: csmake-swak

       Options: (same as "versioning", see csmake --list-type=versioning)
           phases - Phases to execute clear (comma or newline delimited)
       Notes: It is suggested that this section be executed *before*
                TemporalVersioning sections are executed.
                (for: CLDSYS-10109, consider pulling into csmake core)
              This will clear the file %(RESULTS)s/,__temporalversions

           the environment with the key: __TemporalVersioning
